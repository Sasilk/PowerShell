Restore a deleted OneDrive using PowerShell

If you need to restore a deleted OneDrive if the user is deleted earlier than your SharePoint retention period — ie. if the user no longer appears in the ‘Deleted users’ tab in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can still restore it using PowerShell. Follow the steps below and enjoy being called a ‘PowerShell Queen’ :)

Download SharePoint Online Management Shell from the link below.

Find it from your Start menu and run
It will ask you to sign in. Use/select your own account (need to have admin roles)
Connect SharePoint Online Service by running below command
Connect-SPOService -Url https://[your-sharepoint-tenant-prefix]-admin.sharepoint.com

Example:

Connect-SPOService -Url https://mytenant-admin.sharepoint.com

Define deleted user’s OneDrive folder path. Use below as a reference, just replace name and surname with your user’s name and surname.
User Name: name.surname

OneDrive folder: https://[your-sharepoint-tenant-prefix]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_[your_domain]

Example:

https://mytenant-my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_mydomain_co_uk

Run the following command to determine if the OneDrive is available for restore
Get-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://[your-sharepoint-tenant-prefix]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_[your_domain]

Example:

Get-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://mytenant- my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_mydomain_co_uk

If the user’s OneDrive appears in the results, it can be restored.

Restore the OneDrive to an active state
Restore-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://[your-sharepoint-tenant-prefix]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_[your_domain]

Example:

Restore-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://mytenant- my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_mydomain_co_uk

Assign yourself (admin) to OneDrive to access the needed data
Set-SPOUser -Site https://[your-sharepoint-tenant-prefix]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_[your_domain] -LoginName AdminUserName@[YourDomain] -IsSiteCollectionAdmin $True

Example:

Restore-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://mytenant- my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_mydomain_co_uk -LoginName sevcan.asilkan@mydomain.co.uk -IsSiteCollectionAdmin $True

You can now recover data in deleted user’s OneDrive. Basically, just download the files.
After you recover the data you need from the OneDrive, permanently delete the OneDrive by running the following two commands.
Remove-SPOSite -Identity https://[your-sharepoint-tenant-prefix]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_[your_domain]

Remove-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://[your-sharepoint-tenant-prefix]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_[your_domain]

Example:

Remove-SPOSite -Identity https://mytenant- my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_mydomain_co_uk

Remove-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://mytenant- my.sharepoint.com/personal/name_surname_mydomain_co_uk
